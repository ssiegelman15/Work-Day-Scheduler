# Work-Day-Scheduler-HW-WK5

This is a homework project to create a functional work day scheduler using third party APIs (JQuery, BootStrap). The user can input tasks or appointments in the hours of the workday and their entries will be saved on local storage to ensure they are displayed even if the page is refreshed. The background color of the hour tells you if it is past, present or in the future.
